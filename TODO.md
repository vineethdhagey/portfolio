# Color Palette Improvement Plan

## Objective
Update the color palette to use shaded gradients (monochromatic) instead of multi-color gradients for a professional and bold look against the dark background.

## Key Changes
- Replace multi-color gradients with shaded gradients (e.g., shades of purple, blue, or white).
- Enhance text colors for better contrast and readability.
- Make buttons and interactive elements more vibrant with higher saturation.
- Adjust accents to bolder shades for visibility and impact.

## Components to Update
- Hero title: Change to shaded white-to-purple gradient.
- Navigation logo: Shaded purple gradient.
- Section headers: Shaded purple gradient.
- Card icons: Shaded purple gradient.
- Tech badges: Shaded purple gradient.
- Back to top button: Shaded purple gradient.
- Scholarship badge: Shaded purple gradient.
- Resume card: Shaded purple gradient.
- Text elements: Brighter whites with subtle blue tints.
- Links and buttons: Bolder shaded gradients.

## Followup Steps
- Test the updated colors for readability and contrast.
- Ensure responsiveness across devices.
- Verify no performance issues.
